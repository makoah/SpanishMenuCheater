# Product Requirements Document: Menu Cheater Like & Photo Translation

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines two major enhancements to the Spanish Menu Cheater PWA:

1. **Menu Cheater Like System**: Allow users to mark menu items as favorites (üëç) or dislikes (üëé) with local storage and filtering capabilities
2. **Photo Menu Translation**: Enable users to photograph menu boards (like "Menu del D√≠a") and receive side-by-side original and translated views

These features solve the core problem of personalizing the dining experience and handling real-world menu scenarios where items aren't in our database.

## Goals

1. **Personalization**: Enable users to build personal preference profiles for Spanish menu items
2. **Real-world Usability**: Handle photographed menus that don't exist in our curated database
3. **Enhanced Discovery**: Help users filter and find items they know they'll enjoy
4. **Offline Capability**: Maintain functionality without internet connectivity
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with simple implementation, design for future AI enhancements

## User Stories

### Menu Cheater Like System
- **As a traveler**, I want to mark dishes I've tried and loved so I can easily find similar items again
- **As a picky eater**, I want to mark items I disliked so I can avoid them in future searches
- **As a repeat visitor**, I want to filter search results to show only my favorite types of dishes
- **As a dietary-conscious user**, I want to hide items I've marked as dislikes from my search results

### Photo Translation System
- **As a restaurant patron**, I want to photograph a menu board and get translations so I don't have to type each item
- **As a tourist**, I want to understand "Menu del D√≠a" boards that aren't in the app's database
- **As a user with limited Spanish**, I want to see original and translated text side-by-side to learn new words
- **As a mobile user**, I want to use both my camera and existing photos from my gallery

   8.2. Dietary filtering must work on photo-translated results
   8.3. Photo translation must work offline after initial setup

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **User Accounts**: No cloud sync, user registration, or cross-device preferences
2. **Social Features**: No sharing preferences or social recommendations
3. **Advanced AI**: No complex image analysis or AI-powered translation in v1
4. **Real-time Translation**: No live camera overlay or AR features
5. **Menu Database Expansion**: No crowd-sourcing or user-contributed menu items
6. **Price Recognition**: No price extraction or currency conversion from photos
7. **Restaurant Information**: No location data, reviews, or restaurant details

## Design Considerations

### Menu Cheater Like UI Design
- Preference buttons should use standard iOS/Android patterns
- Visual hierarchy: preferences should be noticeable but not overwhelming
- Consider using heart icon (‚ô•Ô∏è) instead of thumbs up for likes
- Filter controls should be accessible but not cluttering search interface

### Photo Translation UI
- Photo capture should use native device camera APIs
- Image preview should show before processing
- Loading states during OCR processing
- Error handling for poor quality photos
- Progressive enhancement: basic functionality first, AI features later

### Responsive Design
- All new features must work on iPhone 320px to desktop
- Touch targets must meet iOS and Android accessibility guidelines
- Consider one-handed operation for preference marking

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage
- localStorage limit is ~5-10MB per domain
- Consider using IndexedDB for larger photo storage if needed
- Implement data cleanup for old unused preferences

### Photo Processing
- Start with lightweight OCR library (Tesseract.js)
- Image compression before processing to improve performance
- Consider WebWorker for OCR to avoid UI blocking

### Performance
- Lazy load photo features to maintain fast app startup
- Optimize image processing for mobile devices
- Maintain offline-first approach

### Dependencies
- Tesseract.js for OCR (can work offline after download)
- Consider camera access permissions and fallbacks
- Progressive enhancement: core app works without photo features

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1: Menu Cheater Like
- **Engagement**: 30% of active users mark at least 5 items as liked within first week
- **Retention**: Users with marked preferences return 2x more often
- **Usage**: Filter functionality used by 60% of users who mark preferences

### Phase 2: Photo Translation
- **Adoption**: 40% of users try photo feature within first month
- **Success Rate**: 70% of photographed menus produce usable translations
- **Satisfaction**: Users report photo feature "very helpful" in feedback

## Open Questions

1. **OCR Accuracy**: What minimum accuracy threshold should trigger fallback to manual entry?
2. **Image Storage**: Should processed photos be cached locally for performance?
3. **Batch Processing**: Should users be able to process multiple photos at once?
4. **Language Detection**: Should system auto-detect if image contains Spanish text?
5. **Accessibility**: How should preferences work with screen readers?
6. **Data Migration**: How to handle localStorage limits when users have many preferences?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Menu Cheater Like System (Implement First)
- Lower complexity, higher immediate value
- Builds on existing search infrastructure
- Provides foundation for Phase 2 integration

### Phase 2: Photo Translation (Implement Second)
- Higher complexity, requires new technology integration
- Benefits from Phase 1 like system being established
- Can be enhanced with AI capabilities in future versions
