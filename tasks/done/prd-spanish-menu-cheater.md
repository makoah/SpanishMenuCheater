# Product Requirements Document: Spanish Menu Cheater

## Introduction/Overview

The Spanish Menu Cheater is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help English and Dutch speakers quickly understand Spanish restaurant menus while dining in Spain. The app addresses the common challenge of navigating unfamiliar menu items, with special focus on dietary restrictions (pork and dairy) that are crucial for families with specific dietary needs.

The application will be a free, offline-capable tool that provides instant lookup of Spanish menu items with translations, dietary information, and price ranges. The solution prioritizes simplicity, speed, and reliability for real-world restaurant use.

## Goals

1. **Instant Menu Item Recognition**: Enable users to quickly search and understand Spanish menu items within seconds
2. **Dietary Safety**: Provide clear, prominent warnings about pork and dairy content to prevent dietary issues
3. **Language Accessibility**: Support both English and Dutch translations for broader accessibility
4. **Zero-Cost Operation**: Deliver a fully functional solution with no hosting or maintenance costs
5. **Offline Reliability**: Ensure the app works in restaurants without requiring internet connectivity
6. **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimize for iPhone usage in restaurant environments

## User Stories

### Primary Use Cases

**US1: Quick Menu Item Lookup**
- As a tourist in a Spanish restaurant, I want to type a menu item name and immediately see its translation and dietary information, so I can make informed ordering decisions without holding up my table.

**US2: Dietary Restriction Safety**
- As a parent with family members who cannot eat pork or dairy, I want to see clear warnings about these ingredients, so I can avoid ordering items that would cause health issues.

**US3: Language Preference**
- As a Dutch speaker who is more comfortable in English in some contexts, I want to switch between English and Dutch translations, so I can use the language that feels most natural in the moment.

**US4: Offline Restaurant Use**
- As a diner in a restaurant with poor WiFi, I want the app to work without internet connection, so I can still access menu information regardless of connectivity.

### Secondary Use Cases

**US5: Price Awareness**
- As a budget-conscious traveler, I want to see typical price ranges for menu items, so I can make cost-effective choices while dining.

**US6: Meat Type Identification**
- As someone with specific meat preferences, I want to quickly identify if a dish contains beef, chicken, fish, or is vegetarian, so I can order according to my preferences.

## Open Questions

### Data Enhancement
1. **Dutch Translations**: The current CSV only includes English translations. Do we need to add Dutch translations for all 200+ items, or should Dutch mode show English translations until Dutch versions are added?

### Future Expansion
2. **Data Updates**: How should new menu items be added to the system over time? Manual CSV updates or eventual migration to a content management approach?

### User Experience
3. **Visual Indicators**: Should we add icon-based indicators (ü•©üê∑üêüü•¨) alongside text warnings for quicker visual recognition?

4. **Search Scope**: Should the search function also include the description field, or focus only on Spanish names and translations to avoid overwhelming results?

### Technical Implementation
5. **PWA Installation**: Should we include prompts encouraging users to install the app to their home screen, or let them discover this feature naturally?
