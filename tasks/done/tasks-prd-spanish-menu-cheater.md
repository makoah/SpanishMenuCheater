### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `dataManager.js` and `dataManager.test.js` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
