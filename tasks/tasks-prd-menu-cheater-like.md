## Relevant Files

- `js/preferenceManager.js` - Core module for managing user likes/dislikes with localStorage persistence
- `js/preferenceManager.test.js` - Unit tests for preferenceManager.js
- `js/photoTranslator.js` - Module for photo capture, OCR processing, and text translation
- `js/photoTranslator.test.js` - Unit tests for photoTranslator.js
- `js/main.js` - Main application file (needs updates for new modules integration)
- `js/main.test.js` - Unit tests for main.js (existing, needs updates)
- `styles/components.css` - Component styles (needs updates for preference buttons and photo UI)
- `index.html` - Main HTML file (needs updates for photo input and filter UI)

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `preferenceManager.js` and `preferenceManager.test.js` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
